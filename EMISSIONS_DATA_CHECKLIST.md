## 💡 DATA ENTRY TIPS

1. **Start with what you have**: Begin with utility bills and work outward
2. **Estimate missing data**: Use industry averages initially, improve over time
3. **Document assumptions**: Always note how estimates were made
4. **Track data sources**: Keep audit trail of where each number came from
5. **Use consistent units**: Convert everything to metric tons CO2e
6. **Validate totals**: Cross-check against spend data, production volumes
7. **Update regularly**: Set up monthly/quarterly data collection processes
8. **Automate where possible**: Integrate with existing business systems
